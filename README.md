The Project 

 our coffee farmers the opportunity to earn rightful compensation for their direct contribution to the specialty coffee supply chain and the wider coffee industry.
By utilizing the framework within the Indorse track, we aim to build a series of NFT collections/collectibles to help support the farmers, their families, and their local communities.
The three main series we have in mind are:
The ‘Coffee Bag Art’ Collectibles: 
Primary Aim: to support and illustrate the stories of our coffee farmers by designing a series of artwork for our coffee bags as a special commission.
Crisis UK, the homeless charity has offered 4-5 artists within their community who would be happy to support this cause and earn a commission. The coffee bags will be available via their e-commerce site and sold in their cafés, of which there are x locations across the UK. 
We have considered a ‘blank canvas’ approach to our coffee bags to showcase more artists, consistently.
‘Farmers’ Kids’ Collection: 
Primary Aim: To support the children of farmers who are often forced to work on the coffee plantations. The Collection will be child-friendly, designed to educate and entertain children whilst learning about coffee farming and personal development skills.
Pieces will be airdropped to wallets owned by farmer households with children to help adoption of cryptocurrency wallets. Our community of coffee drinkers and buyers can purchase these NFTs as well other licensed merchandise in support.
First Drop: December 2021
Coffee Character Collectibles:
 This is a collection created by our artists for the sole purpose of promoting coffee in the world of art in support of the coffee supply chain. Artists will animate coffee beans to create animated characters in either pixel, 2D, or 3D format that we can bring to life digitally as NFTs. These characters can be used to create avatars, children’s books, comics, games.
Primary Aim: To produce a “tsunami” of coffee bean characters that we can flood the market with to bring attention to our ethical cause.
For this series of collectibles we will roll out a global search for artists, with the help of the Superworld Support Team, that will help us decide on who we might select to help build the ‘million bean NFT series’ that we hope to roll out in Q1 of 2022.
As one of the few tech-inspired coffee companies in the world, the aim is to employ a creative and immersive NFT strategy into our operations that engage the Digital Art community, coffee drinkers, and buyers with an interest in innovation.



The Scalability
Product Development Roadmap, 3 Year Outline: 
build an active digital coffee community, possibly social network 
generate coffee related artwork that we buy and sell within our community 
build on or create an NFT marketplace dedicated to the coffee community, with environmental and social factors, in mind.
web-based/mobile application 
acquire virtual land to build coffee shops on the metaverse
acquire physical locations in London, Dubai and Kenya
plan to transport our coffee via ‘Virgin’s Hyperloop’, in a fraction of the time of traditional freight trains.
develop a token-based ecosystem/liquidity pool that benefits all stakeholders within our community
Since learning about the power of NFTs on Clubhouse and Twitter where NFT activity is immense, as CEO, I believed this was a technology we could implement and use to scale. We have in mind, the ‘million bean tsunami’ where we effectively flood the NFT market with our coffee bean characters becoming a movement that is highly sought rather than overlooked.
In June, we had 4 artists produce one NFT each to promote our cause. We started without the team, without the knowledge and without much of a strategy but to able to say that we are the first coffee company to embrace the use of an NFT strategy to benefit our farmers. Each piece was listed at 0.5ETH to split the proceeds of the first sale with the artist on a 50/50 basis. The strategy was not well executed however, with just one person at the helm it’s no surprise that the market did not take much notice of our efforts. The main aim is to now develop a stronger team.
Our existing website is thegoodcoffeeproject.co.uk/com. 
We have secured other crypto-based extensions, such as .crypto to develop on.
The aim here is to build a fully immersive experience on our site(s), where customers can:
use crypto payments, 
access AR/VR experiences
upload QR codes that we add to each coffee bag with a unique tie-in to the coffee farmers growing their beans, where we learn more about their stories and the coffee-growing process.
acknowledge environmental impact of coffee growing and minting NFTs, inspired by projects like ‘NFTtrees’ where trees are planted to offset carbon emissions as a result of the NFT minting process.


The Conclusion
[The Good Coffee Project™️ is dedicated to going beyond the idea of what a coffee company should be. Our NFT collection and accompanying NFT marketplace will be designed seamlessly to help address the massive issue in breaking the chains of forced labour in coffee production and malpractices in the wider distribution channels and chains of value and supply.
There are many lives that would be dependent on the success of this Project and it’s growth. We hope you see the value in this proposition to help provide real-life solutions for humanity through the employment of NFT technology and generative art.
Considering the existing technological frameworks and platforms out there, we believe we can build a fully-customisable solution that coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers would be happy to be a part of, where we aim to build an ever-evolving and inclusive community that considers the human experience as a major part of who we are and our reason for being.
The early stage development of the project has been reliant on existing frameworks within the Ethereum network. 
We have so far used OpenSea and Rarible to mint our smaller previous collection and now looking at more customised and less utilised solutions such as those employing technology by Cardano, the Lightning Network on Bitcoin, the Secret network for anonymous donors making significant contributions, as well as coding programs and opportunities on networks such as Python, JavaScript, Web3 and even Ethereum 2.0.
Superworld is an organisation that has shown interest in supporting the promotion of our ‘Artist Search’ competition as well as affordable land to build our metaphysical stores.
We see ourselves as a digital offering but our success on the Metaverse can be easily translated to physical coffee shops, merchandise and opportunities within the tech industry that other brands, including those outside of specialty coffee that are yet to learn the scope of NFTs in our everyday lives.
